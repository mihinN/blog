### ~A passionate security researcher

#### A Developer

##### and a Writer.

 I'm Mihin, a 23-year-old Computer Science undergraduate from Sri Lanka. 
 I am passionate about security research, proficient in development,
 and also enjoy expressing my thoughts through writing. Currently, I am working on my personal projects, which you can explore below.

### - [x] Simple IDS 
```shell
        	This is an Intrusion Detection System project for my university final year.
```

- [x] Scraper for my own use

- [x] Simple game engine
```shell
        My friends and I are excited about embarking on a game development project. 
        Specifically, we plan to use Unreal Engine for the majority of the development process. 
        However, at the moment, I have ample time to enhance my knowledge,
         and I am working on this project for the sheer joy of it. 
         This opportunity allows me to refine my skills in C++. 
         I am looking forward to the learning journey and the eventual creation of our game.
```
